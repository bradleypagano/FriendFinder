### Problem set Forth

We had to work out how to match users with people that had similar answers to the 10 questions we had laid out.

### How I completed this

I built an array of object that held values that corresponded to the answers that were given during the survey.  After the user submits the survey, the values of the answers get added up and then they are compared to the other users that are in the starting array.  Each user is then added to the array for future queries.
